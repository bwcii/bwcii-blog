## Summary
**Time Spent Studying** : 0:43:49\
**Total Time Spent Studying this Year**  : 94:14:28 \
**Time Remaining this Year** : 905:45:32

**Todays Completed Tasks** : \
✅ Closed my first card on github projects \
✅ Made sure I understood how I left the FireNotes infrastructure \
✅ Set a custom subdomain in firebase for https://firenotes.bwcii.com


Definitely still getting into the swing of things, but glad that my memory of how I left everything was correct. Can't wait to get this stuff pulled together. Next steps will be setting up CI/CD pipelines to deploy to firebase instead of app engine.

## What I learned

Didn't really learn much today. I had late work to do and I've got a go-live that I've managed to get myself tangled up in that starts early next week. I guess you could say that I've learned that whatever study time I had in January I'll need to rediscover this month.

## What I'll be Working on Tomorrow

Tomorrow will be split between a few major things. First off, I'll start the process of setting up CI/CD for the FireNotes repo so that I can just commit code and have the site update itself.

I also need to go over my calendar, how I had it set up in January, and probably revisit my study plan for the year. (Just found the old plan. Definitely need to rewrite this.)

I also want to start reading some technical books, so I'll be reviewing a cool list that [@0xglitchbyte](https://x.com/0xglitchbyte/status/1775529740981477715?s=20) posted. I may already have some of them, but just from scanning it I have a feeling it's a gold mine.

## Conclusion

I'm still recovering from burnout and don't want to fall back into the hole I just crawled out of, so I won't be pushing through to try and squeeze 3 hours of studying out of the remainder of the day. However, I'm happy that I'm back at this. Happy to see that little line chart on the home page start to tick up, and excited to try and make up for 2 months of lost time! lol

Thanks for reading! Have a good night!
