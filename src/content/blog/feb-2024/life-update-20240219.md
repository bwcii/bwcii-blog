Hello everyone!

It's been a while since my last post, but I'm back!

I had some unexpected surgery that laid me out for several days and I'm only just now comfortable enough to get back to updating this blog. It's probably nothing serious btw, just life throwing me a curve is all.

I'll start ramping up studying later this week to try and dig myself out of the 44 hour deficit I'm in, but I've got 10 months to get back on track.

## BTW!

I've never felt so thankful for the internet and the ability to communicate with friends and strangers. X.com has been a life saver, Starlink internet has pushed more data this month than ever before, and being able to do telemed over the internet has saved me from taking trips to the doctor's office.

I'm so grateful for all of you who participate in building a better and safer internet. There's so much to look forward and it takes a village to get ther!

Have a good day.
