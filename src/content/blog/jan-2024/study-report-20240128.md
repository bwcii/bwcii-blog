âœ… Build a working example of a table using the mat-table data-table based off of an example [HERE](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview)

Man, this weekend was definitely a lesson in work/life balance. Since 1/24/2024 I've fallen almost 10 hours behind my study goal. Guess what! I don't regret it for a second.

Work got really crazy towards the weekend. I had to do some after hours work that sucked up a good chunk of the evening this Saturday. I'd love to talk about that, but I can't unfortunately. I will say that weeks of planning let me complete a change with a maintenance window of 4 hours in 30 minutes, and there wasn't even a single problem!

I also got to spend time at a friends house warming party, got to see my parents, and got to bake the worlds best chocolate chip cookies for dinner guests this weekend.

Am I frustrated I didn't hit my study goals? Yeah, a little bit if I'm going to be honest. Would I give up a years worth of studying to make memories with friends and family that I'd never be able to go back and make? Absolutely! Life is too shortto waste on a book that's happy to be read next week.

## What I learned

Even though my entire weekend was full of things that took me away from my desk, I still managed to get some studying in. It wasn't much, but it was something. 

I've been working on the frontend of my Angular Playground web app to get it ready to accept a pretty big json response from the myip.bwcii.com api with the goal of showing some of, but not all, of the public IP information for the client. I want to put it into a table that's easy to read and hopefully really responsive to screen size. I figured that if I build it this way, then if needed I can just update the API response from my api and add a couple fields to the receiving Observable and have my table automatically update with the new data.

But man, the mat-table component is not intuitive at all. Now granted, I've only spent about two hours on it, but it's still surprisingly difficult to play with. I've gone over some of the documentation, but there's still some part of my mental model that's not completely developed. I got the example code working well enough, so I can't blame my dev environment or anything.

IDK. It's still too soon for me to really complain, and based on the example code I think it'll look really nice. I have to say, the team behind Material Design is amazing. I love all of their elements and in general they're pretty easy to use. Definitely a ton of value for the time it takes to implement them. It's also nice to not have to re-invent the basics of UI design. I've always had a heck of a time taking what I see in my mind and drawing/designing something to match it. It's a great design system to get you started.

## What I'll be Working on Tomorrow

Tomorrow I'd like to have the UI for the IP Geolocation element completed. I've already got a mock API response created so I can pull from it like it's an actual web call, minus the actual web call of course. If I can get that finished tomorrow, then I should be able to update the API back end before friday. Then I'll be able to cross that whole component off of my to-do list.

Once that's done, I'll move to adding a stateful component that does something simple. Maybe just track the total number of times a button has been clicked. Just enough complexity to get fire store involved in this project.

## Conclusion

I've got quite a bit of studying to do this week to try and catch back up from what I missed this weekend, but I've been through worse. Just another week in paradise!

I think I may add some project oriented goals to my study time line. Just enough to make sure I'm staying focused on one project without jumping all over the place. Still not sure.

Maybe you can hit me up on twitter and let me know what you think. Definitely let me know if you're building something cool!
