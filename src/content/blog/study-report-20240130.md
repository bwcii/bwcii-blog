I'm pleasently surprised with how much I got done today. That being said, I'm exhausted from work and life in general today, so this is going to be a pretty short post.

## What I learned

I learned that I really enjoy the way that interfaces are used in typescript and rust to act as guard rails at compile time when you're trying to manipulate json values and observables.

I also learned that in this last month, I've honestly learned quite a lot! I just started working on firebase stuff and it reminded me of the first time I logged into GCP to start learning about it. Everything's so new and can be pretty complex, but I'm sure that as I use it that it will start making sense and start growing on me.


## What I'll be Working on Tomorrow

Tomorrow I'll finish registering my subdomain to firebase hosting and hopefully get my CI/CD pipelines updated to deploy directly to firebase instead of app engine. Nothing wrong with app engine, but why have the site in two places.

After that, it's going to be a couple boring days of researching firebase, enabling google analytics for the angular playground correctly, and then hopefully learning how to use firebase authentication.

## Conclusion

I'm super tired, but I took some good steps forward today! ðŸŽ‰ Woot ðŸŽ‰

Time to get some rest and potentially review my schedule to make sure I'm leaving enough time for myself to sleep. I can tell I've been running a sleep deficite and if work/life is going to continue to be busy for a while I'll have to adjust to make sure my brain is in tip top shape.
