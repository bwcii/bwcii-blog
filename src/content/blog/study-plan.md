Hello everyone!

This post is to lay out some of the things I've learned to do in the 7 years I've been studying I.T. and programming. Like anything else, studying is a skill that requires practice and continual improvement. Hopefully this post will help those of you that are teaching yourself some good ways to study consistantly long term without getting burnt out.


## Things that have worked well FOR ME!
*obilgatory reminder - What works for me may not work well for you. It probably will though.

**Time Tracking**

The entire time I was in school, I never tracked my studying. Like most people, I studied only when I thought I had to. This led to last minute cramming, short periods of high stress, and a general hatred of studying. 

Fortunately for most of us, we can't cram. There's no deadline for long term self improvement. Unfortunately most of us still carry over our cramming study trauma from school and this causes most of us to indefinitely delay the first step of studying. We've only studied because of the "stick" and have never studied for the "carrot".

The **only** way I've ever been able to study consistantly is by tracking my time and to set study goals for myself. 

Selecting goals is important, but not worth getting stuck on. When I was just beginning and felt like I would drown from all the things I could learn, certifications were my go to. They made great goals because they had a self contained subject matter. Now that I use time based goals. Enter the 1,000 hour a year goal I'm working on now. 

I've used google spreadsheets, flipd on iOS, and Clockify among other time tracking platforms. The medium itself doesn't matter and you should use the minimum level of granularity that you can tolerate. It keeps it simple and when it comes to tools that support your studying. You're not trying to learn how to use an enterprise time tracking software, at least I hope not!

Here's an example of what my current time tracking spreadsheet looks like.

Believe it or not, the most imporatnt column on the table is column E "Actual - Desired Hours." This column shows me if I'm ahead or behind my study goals. If I'm ahead, I don't feel bad taking a day off. If I'm behind, I still don't feel bad taking a day off because life happens and I can always catch back up. This brings me to my next study tool...

**Setting reasonable goals**

In my unhealthy prime, I was single, studying 10 hours a day, working 8 hours a day, sleeping 4 hours a day, and left only a couple hours in my schedule for eating, and keeping clean. This was misserible, unhealthy, and not sustainable. I forced myself to do this for almost a year and it ground me to dust. 

*Don't do that!*

Use a calendar, block off family time and releaxation, and set realistic goals. Have as much of your day put into your calendar as possible. Don't forget, just because it's in your calendar doesn't mean you have to do it! It's just a plan, and like any plan you should expect to deviate from it from time to time. That's ok!

If you're just starting out then please don't use any of my study goals for yourself. Like anything else, you have to practice studying to build up dicipline to continue when it's difficult and the wisdom to stop when before you burn out. Start with 15 or 30 minutes a day. If you can do that for 2 weeks, then bump up by a half hour. 3 hours a day might not seem like much, but try doing that 365 days in a row.

**Study your study habits**

The reason that I start by focusing on time tracking and setting reasonable goals is that they're essential to find a study pattern that works for you. If you're not measuring how you're studying, how do you know you're studying correctly?

What do I mean by that you ask? Reference the below graph to see what I mean.

As you can see, I study pretty close to my daily goals for for 6 days in a row, then take at least a day off after that. Knowing this, I can give myself permission to take a day off around then because I know this pattern works for me. I get caught right back up to my goal within a day or two after my day off.
