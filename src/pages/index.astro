			<h1>Hello, Everyone!</h1>
			<p>
				Welcome to my blog!
			</p>
			<p>
				My name is Benjamin Crouch II. I've been working in I.T. Operations for several years.
				I've worked on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD ‚ù§üòà‚ù§, enterprise networking, information security, DevOps, and everything else I could get my hands on... except for software engineering and databases.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>WELL THIS YEAR THAT ENDS!</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				Starting 1/1/2023 I've been working towards spending 1,000 hours studying software engineering, databases, and building scalable web apps.
				I hope you enjoy following me through my journey. I'm sure I'll stumble across a lot of difficult and interesting things, and I'd love to share them with you.
